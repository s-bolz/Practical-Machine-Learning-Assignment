# Human Activity Recognition Analysis

This analysis is part of the programming assignment for the MOOC
[Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn). It
uses the
[Weight Lifting Dataset](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/work.jsf?p1=11201)
by E. Velloso, A. Bulling, H. Gellersen, W. Ugulino, and H. Fuks to predict the
quality of barbell lifts.
